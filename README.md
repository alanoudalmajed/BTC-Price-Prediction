# **From Data to Decisions: Utilizing a Hybrid Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Bitcoin Trading**

This project includes two repositories:  

1. **Dataset Repository**: Contains the prepared dataset and data preprocessing steps.  
2. **Model Repository**: Features the Hybrid Deep Learning (HDL) model for Bitcoin price prediction and the Reinforcement Deep Learning (RDL) model functioning as an agent.  

The project aims to improve Bitcoin price predictions by integrating historical prices, sentiment analysis from news articles, and relevant economic indicators using a comprehensive approach combining Hybrid Deep Learning (HDL) and Reinforcement Deep Learning (RDL). This will be achieved by following these objectives:
1.	Create a dataset that includes historical Bitcoin prices and economic indicators like gold prices and stock indices.
2.	Analyze news articles to determine sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using text analysis, then combine it with a dataset.
3.	Use Hybrid Deep Learning Model to enhance pricesâ€™ prediction by combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). 
4.	Use a Reinforcement Deep Learning (RDL) agent to make buy, sell, or hold decisions. This agent should reward accurate predictions and adjust based on market changes.
